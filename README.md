I'm pretty sure in my code, but for some reason maven bugged and didn't see the json module I added to dependencies. Therefore, even though I searched the first few pages of several different search engines and tried to ask gpt-4, It still kept saying that java.lang.ClassNotFoundException, so I couldn't run the project and use it myself. I hope it runs on your computer, because it seems to be the problem with maven/java and not my code.

UPD: **It seems that you need java 19** to use json, otherwise it gives strange errors that internet does not know about
